Description: StateTrace automates many aspects of a state-trace
        analysis of accuracy and other binary response data, including
        implementing Bayesian methods quantifying evidence about the
        outcomes of a state-trace experiment and the creation of
        customisable graphs. It also offers users either a GUI or
        non-GUI (i.e., command line input) implementation of the
        contained functions
